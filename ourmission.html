            Long live Kim Il-Sung.
            Kim Jong-Il, sun of the 21st century.
            Let’s live our own way.
            We will do as the party tells us.
            We have nothing to envy in the world.

        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>
            Because of the many hardships North Korea has faced due to its bad economic decisions such as loss or limited electricity and severe famine (Demick 4, 145), many North Koreans are aware that the propaganda they’re being fed is convoluted (Demick 194)
            but they don’t have the proper resources to educate themselves due to the intricate intranet the North Korean regime has put in place (Fisher) and limits on using even that form of internet. Even foreigners have limited access to the internet
            or intranet due to North Korea’s need to ensure that no outside information reaches its citizens (McFarland). Our mission at the Kim-dle project is to deliver information from the outside world into North Korea in order to inspire change and
            or defection in those who are fed up with the censorship and propaganda present in their country.

        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>
            The Kim-dle is a name given to our version of a kindle that is used for the same purpose: to read. However, as opposed to the Kindle, the Kim-dle has pre-downloaded books exclusively about history and current events that have been hidden or manipulated
            by the North Korean government such as the real story of the Korean war (Demick 18-29). These e-books, however, will not explicitly display outside information, for that could result in the death or imprisonment of its readers (State Department).
            The books will be disguised as North Korean propaganda or approved books so as to not raise suspicions, but when you highlight the given texts, the true text is revealed, giving the information we wish to share. The cases will even be designed
            to look like the North Korean flag in order to further distract the government from the truth and trick them into believing that their citizens are simply reading North Korean praises on a Kim-dle.
