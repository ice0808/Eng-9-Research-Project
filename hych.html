            Long live Kim Il-Sung.
            Kim Jong-Il, sun of the 21st century.
            Let’s live our own way.
            We will do as the party tells us.
            We have nothing to envy in the world.

        <h1>How You Can Help</h1>
        <p>
            Imagine living in a world where expressing any thoughts that went against societal ideals would lead to extreme punishment of not only yourself, but your entire family; a world so oppressive where even voicing your opinions would be unheard of. This is,
            unfortunately, the harsh reality for the citizens of North Korea. They live “under a system that sought to stamp out [those who have a bad family background] for three generations, [where punishments] would extend to parents, grandparents,
            brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, cousins.” (Demick 194) These citizens deserve to have their voice heard. They deserve to live a life free from oppression, a life where they don’t have to worry about slaving away at a prison camp for the
            rest of their lives just because they made a joke about their leader’s height. This is where you come in, your contributions will directly impact the fight against North Korean censorship. You can contribute to the fight against North Korean
            censorship in several ways:
        </p>
        <p>
            Donations. Your donations to our organization will go into the production fees for manufacturing Kim-dles, importing them to North Korea, and other factors involved in expanding our initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
            Becoming a translator. Translators who can understand Korean and convert it into other languages, especially English, greatly assist our initiative by overcoming the language barrier between North Korea and the rest of the world. They play a key role
            in communication, allowing us to better understand and spread the experiences exclusive to the citizens of North Korea. Through your contribution of linguistics, you can give a voice to those oppressed under the North Korean regime.
        </p>
        <p>
            Buying our merchandise. We offer a variety of beautiful, well-made stickers that encompass our cause in a physical form. By buying our merchandise, you would be directly supporting the manufacturing and distribution of Kim-dles, furthering our initiative.
            Moreover, wearing or showing these lovely stickers helps spread awareness about our cause, thus furthering the reach of our mission.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our organization is built off a foundation of integrity and dedication. We have spent tireless hours investigating and researching the intricacies of North Korean censorship, propaganda, and the government itself. Our credibility is evident in the extensive
            research that has been conducted over the course of decades and the trustworthiness of various databases we utilized along the way. By joining our cause, you can have faith that your investment will further an ethical, much-needed, and impactful
            initiative: ending censorship in North Korea.
