            Uri Abogi, our father, 
            we have nothing to envy in the world. 
            Our house is within the embrace of the Workers’ Party.

        <h1>Censorship and Propaganda</h1>
        <p>
            Propaganda can be defined as the act of controlling information to support a certain political point of view. Propaganda can come in many ways, ranging from the distortment of information to selectively releasing information that support the views of
            the political agenda.(Caliendo, 481) On the other hand, censorship is completely silencing information all together. Censorship is the suppression of ideas and media that don’t align with or challenge the ideals of a society. State controlled
            media is a way of censoring unwanted media by granting the government complete control over what information enters or leaves a state.

            Despite being unconstitutional, the North Korean regime heavily practices censorship mainly by restricting any anti-North Korean media from entering the country. In North Korea, the reason why their ideologies and government has withstood decades of hardship
            (which could have been easily avoided), is because of the intricate system of state-controlled media and propaganda that the government enforced. If propaganda is supposed to enforce a political perspective, what message is allowing the government
            system to stay for this long? The deification of the government leader.The idealization of government leaders is perfect to maintain control of the citizens because doing so will allow the citizens to think that if they disagree with the government,
            who are regularly praised in the media, they are technically defying god. It is actually illegal to bring any religious items in the country, the leader is the only one you should worship. These ideologies are exposed all the way from infancy.
            Personal accounts of North Korean defectors reveal when they left North Korea, they had a hard time adjusting to the major cultural gap, because of how much the oppressive government controlled their mindset/life.(Demick,253).

            During the famine of the 1990s, many citizens were left to fend for themselves in the black market as a result of unemployment. Because of how much communism was enforced and the antagonization of capitalism in the media , they were unable to establish
            marketing strategies needed to make money effectively. Along with the antagonization of capitalism, they also have antagonized surrounding countries as well. North Korean propaganda has depicted North Korea as the colorful hero against the
            brutal United States, which in reality is false. The United States has tried to reach out with humanitarian aid during the electricity crisis and famine in exchange for placing a hold on nuclear weapon plans. (Sherman and Revere). But North
            Korea broke that agreement and North Koreans blame America because of propaganda. (Demick,4). Propaganda in North Korea stretches out even into the education system. All history in North Korea is “official history” which is a doctored sequence
            of events that align with the views of the government. An example of a difference between North Korea’s “official history” and actual history is the recorded events of the Korean War. According to the “official history”, South Korea invaded
            first under the order of America, when in reality, North Korea stormed the 38th parallel first.
